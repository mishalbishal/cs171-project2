          <h2>Bar Graph</h2>
          <p>This visualization displays the popularity of chess openings. Since chess is a very old game, each of these openings have over time developed variants. As there may be hundreds of variants for a particular opening; we have removed the clutter and grouped each of the variants within their particular overall opening category.</p>
          <p>Clicking on a overall opening group allows you to bring up the bar graph representing the specific variants for that opening.</p>

          <h2>Scatterplot</h2>
          <p>This set of linked scatter plots graphs the frequency of an opening move's 
          use versus is chances of resulting in a win, lose or draw. Information about each 
          point appears in a box above.The data was calculated
          by going through a database of hundreds of thousands of games, categorizing them
          by the opening move used, and then calculating how many of those games resulted
          in a particular outcome. The graphs allow the user to observe how a move's 
          success rate correlates with its popularity.</p>
